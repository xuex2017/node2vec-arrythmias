This study conforms to the Declaration of Helsinki. It was conducted in accordance with the French guidelines for genetic research and with the approval of the local medical ethics committees. Informed written consent was obtained from all patients. Baseline 12-lead ECGs were recorded at a paper speed of 25 mm/s. According to the current guidelines, BrS-ECG was defined as an ST-segment elevation with type-1 morphology [2 mm in, at least, 1 lead among the right precordial leads V1, V2, positioned in the 2nd, 3rd or 4th intercostal space, occurring either spontaneously or after provocative drug test with intravenous administration of Class I antiarrhythmic drugs . Ajmaline (1 mg/kg body weight) was used for drug testing. An electrophysiological study (EPS) was carried out in selected cases. Echocardiography, chest roentgenogram and exercise testing excluded any underlying structural heart disease. Laboratory tests excluded acute ischemia and metabolic or electrolyte disturbances. ECG parameters were assessed: heart rate (HR), PQ interval in lead II, QRS duration, maximal ST elevation in right precordial leads and QTc duration in V4 (Bazett formula), blinded to the genetic status.
