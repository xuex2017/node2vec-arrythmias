A 57-year-old male hypertensive Caucasian patient on medical treatment for 1.5 months for non-organic-related AF was hospitalized in the ICU because of highventricular response AF (170 per minute). Biphasic CV with 100J was performed on the patient under medical treatment, and sinus rhythm was maintained. The patient had high-ventricular response AF (160 per minute) again after 2 days, biphasic CV with 200J was conducted again, and sinus rhythm was maintained. An apnea test (AT) was performed on the same night because frequent apneas were observed during sedation, and his body mass index (BMI) was 40.9kg/m 2. The results were as follows: apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) of 71 per hour, desaturation period of 28 minutes, and minimum peripheral oxygen saturation (SpO 2 ) of 68 %. The patient was discharged with nocturnal BiPAP—expiratory positive airway pressure of 8cm H 2 O and inspiratory positive airway pressure of 14cm H 2 O—and medical treatment. The patient was in sinus rhythm at the 1-month follow-up; thus, medication doses were decreased, AT was performed under BiPAP at the 6-month follow-up, and the results were as follows: AHI of 1 per hour, desaturation period of 1 minute, and minimum SpO 2 of 87 %. The patient did not have AF within these 6 months. At the 12th month, the patient decided to undergo gastric bypass surgery. Up to the time of surgery, nocturnal BiPAP and medical treatment were continued. Within 6 months after the medical surgery, the patient lost 40kg and only medical treatment was continued. In the AT conducted in the 18th month (via spontaneous breathing), results in the range of AHI of 5 per hour, apnea index of 1 per hour, and minimum SpO 2 of 93 % were observed; hence, bisoprolol fumarate was ended .
