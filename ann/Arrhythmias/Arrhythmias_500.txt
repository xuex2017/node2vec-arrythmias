We report a 15-year old Caucasian girl, oldest child of unaffected, non-consanguineous parents; she has two ). Developmental milestones were normal, she walked unsupported at 12 months of age but at 8 years she started to toe-walk and developed foot deformity. She had no cardiac signs or symptoms. Long QT was first seen on routine ECG before foot surgery when she was 11. At 12 years she presented with bilateral pes cavus deformity, deep tendon reflexes in lower extremities were absent, vibration sense was reduced up to the ankles. She was toe-walking but had no other motor impairment. Nerve conduction studies revealed axonal-demyelinating sensory-motor polyneuropathy with conduction velocity (cv) in median/ulnar motor nerves 38 m/s. Echocardiography at that time was not relevant. The level of creatine kinase (CK) was elevated to 1.5 times upper limit of normal. At 13 years she was diagnosed with restrictive cardiomyopathy. She had rigidity of cervical and thoracic spine and contractures at hips, knees and ankles. Muscle biopsy confirmed myofibrillar myopathy. She was last seen at 15 years with asymptomatic long QT. Her pulmonary function was normal [forced vital capacity (FVC) 87 %]. Spinal rigidity and contractures further limited her mobility but she was ambulant. The blood sample was subjected to direct sequencing for BAG3 and heterozygous mutation Pro209Leu (c.626C [ T) in exon 3 was revealed (see ). Proband's mother, father and siblings do not carry this mutation and do not present any muscle dysfunction .
