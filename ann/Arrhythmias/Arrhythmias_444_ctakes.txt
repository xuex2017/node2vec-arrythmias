A 48-year-old woman was referred to our hospital due to syncope. Her electrocardiogram showed ventricular fibrillation, and her consciousness was recovered by two automated external defibrillator shocks. Left ventricular (LV) ejection fraction was 16% and QRS duration was 177 ms with left bundle branch block. She underwent CRT-defibrillator (CRT-D) implantation. After implantation of the right atrial lead and shock lead, CS venography was performed. The venography showed only one adequate anterior branch to introduce LV lead , and we planned to introduce an LV lead to the branch. We could introduce an LV lead (Medtronic 4398-88 cm) to the distal edge of the anterior branch, and tested the pacing threshold and PNS threshold . Although PNS occurred by distal bipolar pacing (distal 1mid 2) and proximal pacing (mid 3-proximal 4) (5.0V at 0.4 ms, and the pacing threshold was 2.5V at 0.4 ms), mid shortspaced bipolar pacing (mid 2-3) did not induce phrenic nerve stimulation until 9V pacing (the pacing threshold was 1.5V at 0.4 ms). We attempted to use a right ventricular coil as an anode, however, the pacing of all distal electrodes (distal 1 to proximal 4) as cathode resulted in PNS by 3.0V at 0.4 ms. She was discharged without any other complications. Three months later, we checked her PNS and pacing threshold. When we used the right ventricular coil as a proximal electrode, the pacing of all distal electrodes (distal 1 to proximal 4) still resulted in PNS by 3.0V at 0.4 ms. However, PNS never occurred by distal bipolar pacing (distal 1-mid 2) or proximal pacing (mid 3-proximal 4) by 3.0V at 0.4 ms. X-rays showed a significant reduction of the cardio-thorax ratio .
