A 28-year-old man, diagnosed with hypertension and hyperlipidemia 1 month prior, was admitted for abdominal pain and vomiting. He was started on amlodipine 30 days prior to hospitalization and had no other significant personal history. On admission, he received only a 10-mg IV dose of metoclopramide over 5 s and immediately became unconscious and cyanotic. He was transferred to the intensive care unit. Cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) with intubation resulted in return of spontaneous circulation in 10 minutes followed by return of consciousness and extubation within 2.5 hours. No medications were given during CPR. His electrocardiogram (QT/QTc values were 316/383 ms), serial cardiac enzymes (CK-MB and troponin-T), and chest X-ray were normal, with an echocardiogram showing trivial tricuspid regurgitation and no other abnormalities. His vital signs were as follows: blood pressure, 140/85 mmHg; temperature, 38°C; and pulse, 100 bpm. Laboratory results, measured post-CPR, showed a normal toxicology report, serum creatinine = 1.2 mg/dL, urea = 10.6 mg/dL, potassium = 3.1 mEq/L, phosphorus = 6.5 mg/dL, calcium = 9 mg/dL, magnesium = 1.6mEq/L, C-reactive protein = 0.63mg/dL, ALT = 54unit/L, AST = 42 unit/L, INR = 1.2, albumin = 4.3g/dL, and white blood cells = 14 700/µL. After stabilization, Scopolamine and Spasmo-canulase (cellulase, dehydrocholic acid, dimeticone, glutamic acid hydrochloride, metixene hydrochloride, pancreatin, and pepsin) were used to manage the patient's gastrointestinal discomfort. On day 7 of the hospitalization, the patient developed on-and-off fevers (T Max = 39°C) and diarrhea. The patient was discharged after all culture results were negative, and the fever resolved 3 days later.
