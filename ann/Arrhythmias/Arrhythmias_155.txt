A 22-year-old male patient was admitted to our hospital with repeated discharges of the implantable cardioverter defibrillator caused by pleomorphic ventricular tachycardia. He had a previous history of survived sudden cardiac death and an implanted single-chamber implantable cardioverter defibrillator in 2010. No data on work-up of genetic arrhythmias had been available to date. On current clinical presentation in echocardiography, normal ejection fraction and heart diameter could be determined. Because of abnormal ECG pattern in a sense of an incomplete right bundle branch block with slightly elevated ST-segments and T-wave inversions in the right precordial leads, an ajmaline test was conducted . This resulted in prominent coved-type Brugada ECG . An electrophysiological study was performed. During programmed ventricular stimulation (500/S4), a sustained and hemodynamically nontolerated ventricular tachycardia (VT) with superior axis and R/S transition in V5 was induced reproducibly . During endocardial voltage mapping, no pathological electrograms were found in the endocardial right ventricular/right ventricular outflow tract . Because of a suspected epicardial right ventricular outflow tract exit and the lack of endocardial substrate, an epicardial mapping was performed. The epicardial electrograms recorded from the lateral tricuspid annulus, and the anterior right ventricular outflow tract showed low-voltage zones and late potentials during sinus rhythm . During substrate modification, repetitive spontaneous VTs occurred. Ablation end point was the loss of ventricular pace capture with full output (10 V/2 ms) pacing in low-voltage zone and noninducibility of any VT during programmed ventricular stimulation. In addition, a genetic test was conducted. The abnormity of the SCN5A gene was not detected, but mutations of PKP2 and DSP genes were revealed. During 9 months of followup, device interrogation showed no recurrence of any VT episodes.
