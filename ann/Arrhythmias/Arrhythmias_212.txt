A 58-year-old patient with a 3-year history of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation underwent circumferential pulmonary vein isolation (PVI) in 2012. After 3 months, he presented with a symptomatic LAMRT with a cycle length of 385 ms (. ). The patient was on amiodarone (200 mg daily). A PVI-redo was performed using a novel circular mapping and ablation catheter (nMarq®, Biosense Webster, Diamond Bar, Calif., USA). This is a tenelectrode steerable lasso-shaped catheter that allows irrigated unipolar and bipolar radiofrequency (RF) ablation (cool flow of 60 ml/min). Each electrode can be switched on and off separately. For PVI, an antral ablation (outside the PV) was performed. After single transseptal puncture, a CARTO 3 map of the left atrium was acquired using the nMarq® catheter. The activation map revealed an LAMRT with its exit to the left atrium (LA) at the roof of the left superior pulmonary vein (LSPV) and its entrance at the bottom of the left inferior pulmonary vein (LIPV; . ) By placing the nMarq® catheter at the ostium of the LSPV, the activation sequence could be nicely depicted. Pacing from the roof of the LSPV showed perfect entrainment (PPI +8 ms) and a similar pwave morphology compared to the tachycardia. Ablation at this site terminated the LAMRT. The exit to the LA was blocked. Conduction into the left pulmonary veins was still present because of the gap at the bottom of the LIPV (. ). After ablation at this site, the lateral pulmonary veins were isolated. The septal ablation line showed gaps in the anterior–inferior part, which were successfully closed. At the end of the procedure there was no inducible tachycardia. The septal and lateral PVs were isolated. The patient was free of any tachycardia for 6 months.The accompanying manuscript does not include studies on humans or animals.
