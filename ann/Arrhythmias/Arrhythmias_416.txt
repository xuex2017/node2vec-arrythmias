A man in his early 30s was seen in consultation for CBTs. He had noticed a mass on the right side of his neck approximately 6 months before he went to see his primary health care provider (PCP). Other than noticing the mass, the patient was completely asymptomatic and denied any pain, difficulty swallowing or breathing, voice changes, difficulty moving his tongue, tremors, or palpitations. The patient did have a 5-year history of hypertension that had been relatively resistant to medical management. In addition to his family history being significant for hypertension, it was also notable that his paternal grandmother, 2 paternal cousins, and his sister had CBTs. IMPORTANCE Carotid body tumors are rare neoplasms of neural crest origin that are both highly vascularized and locally invasive. Treatment options for these tumors often include surgery with preoperative embolization, which can pose major cardiovascular risk to patients. As demonstrated by this case report, hemodynamic instability following preoperative embolization of a carotid body tumor may indicate severe carotid sinus hypersensitivity and the need for temporary cardiac pacing.
