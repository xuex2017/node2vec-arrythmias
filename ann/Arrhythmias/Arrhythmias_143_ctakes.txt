The patient was a 41-year-old woman 161 cm in height and 70 kg in weight. She had been scheduled for simple hysterectomy due to a diagnosis of uterine myomas. A preoperative electrocardiogram (ECG) revealed rst-degree A-V block (PR interval: 0.244 sec) . Transechocardiography indicated favorable wall motion, and the ejection fraction was approximately 69% by modified Simpson method. The results of chest X-ray and other laboratory tests were within the normal range. The patient had no indication of potential problems and she was not on any medication. An earlier medical examination at the company at which she was employed had found evidence of arrhythmia, but this was ruled out after she was required to undergo Holter ECG at a nearby hospital. Premedication comprised intravenous drip infusion of 3 mg midazolam, 20 mg famotidine and 0.5 mg atropine sulfate at 30 min before entering the operating theater. Blood pressure was 130/70 mmHg and pulse rate was 85/min on admission to the operating theater. First-degree AV block was revealed on ECG. An epidural catheter was inserted between vertebrae L1 and L2, and a test dose of 1 ml of 1% lidocaine injected. Anesthesia was induced with intravenous infusion of 3 ng/ml propofol (Target Control Infusion), 0.5 c remifentanil, and 8 mg vecuronium followed by intubation. No changes were observed in the patient＇s ECG readings after tracheal intubation. Anesthesia was maintained by air (5 L/min), oxygen (1 L/min), and continuous intravenous infusion of propofol (1.0 to 2.0 ng/ml) and remifentanil (0.2 to 0.25 c) along with suitable administration of vecuronium. Anesthetic depth was adjusted to a Bispectral Index (BIS) value ranging from 40 to 60. Depth of sedation was monitored with a BIS monitor. No changes were observed in her ECG readings at the time of initial incision. At 60 min following incision, continuous epidural block was started at 4 ml/hr (92 ml of 0.2% ropivacaine + 8 ml fentanyl = 100 ml) for postoperative analgesia. Although blood pressure subsequently showed a gradual decrease, this was counteracted by an increase in infusion volume with commencement of auto-transfusion of ephedrine hydrochloride. At 120 min following the initial incision, indigo carmine was administered to determine whether any ureteral injury had been incurred intraoperatively. Shortly after administration of indigo carmine, the PQ interval began to lengthen gradually and the QRS wave form dropped out on the ECG monitor ( , upper ~middle), leading to a diagnosis of Wenckebach type A-V block. Although the patient＇s status was stable, a follow-up was conducted. No improvement was observed in the Wenckebach type A-V block for the next 5 min, so 0.5 mg atropine sulfate was administered. The Wenckebach type A-V block subsequently recovered to rst-degree A-V block ( , low). Surgery was completed without further incident, and the patient was extubated.
