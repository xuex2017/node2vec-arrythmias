A 66-year-old man underwent catheter ablation for paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (AF) using an irrigation catheter, for which the 15-mg rivaroxaban (standard dose in Japan) he had been taking was discontinued. Pericardial effusion (PE) was not evident on the post-procedure intracardiac echocardiography, and rivaroxaban was re-administered. He was discharged symptom-free from the hospital 2 days later (blood pressure , 118/56 mmHg; heart rate , 80 bpm). He remained symptom-free at follow-up 30 days post-procedure (BP, 124/80 mmHg; HR, 70 bpm). Serum hemoglobin was unchanged at 16.6 mg/dL. He developed chest discomfort with hypotension 55 days after the procedure (BP, 104/80 mmHg; HR, 90 bpm). Transthoracic echocardiography revealed a large amount of PE, prompting a diagnosis of delayed cardiac tamponade (DCT). Emergency pericardiocentesis was performed to aspirate hemorrhagic effusion (850 mL), followed by rapid symptom improvement. Serum hemoglobin decreased to 11.9 mg/dL, necessitating a blood transfusion. Rivaroxaban was discontinued. He experienced no further signs of PE.
